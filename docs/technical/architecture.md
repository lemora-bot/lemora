# Technical Architecture

## Overview

The Lemora Wallet Tracker utilizes a modular architecture for scalability, maintainability, and performance. The system comprises several components, each responsible for specific functions.

---

## System Components

### 1. **Frontend**
- Developed using React and TypeScript
- Provides a responsive UI and real-time updates
- Directly interacts with the backend for data rendering and user interactions

### 2. **Backend API**
- Built with Node.js and Express
- Handles requests from the frontend and external clients
- Manages authentication, data retrieval, and processing

### 3. **Data Processing Layer**
- Comprised of microservices for separate functionalities
- Processes real-time data streams and aggregates results

## Data Flow

### 1. **User Interactions**
- Initiated from the frontend; the backend API handles the authentication and request processing
- Responsive UI updates based on real-time data

### 2. **Data Collection**
- Distributed microservices collect data from Solana blockchain nodes
- Enriched with additional data from third-party APIs

### 3. **Real-Time Processing**
- Event-driven architecture utilizes message queues for processing
- Real-time analytics and AI models provide insights and alerts

### 4. **Data Storage**
- Uses a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for optimal storage and retrieval
- Caches frequently accessed data for improved performance

### 5. **Security**
- Implements industry-standard encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Microservices

### **Wallet Monitoring Service**
- Continuously monitors specified wallets for activity
- Sends notifications based on predefined triggers and conditions

### **Transaction Analysis Service**
- Provides deep insights into individual transactions
- Leverages AI for risk and strategy analysis

---

## Scaling Strategy

- Auto-scaling components based on load and demand
- Uses container orchestration for managed deployments

---

## Future Developments

- Integration with more data sources for comprehensive insights
- Development of additional machine learning models
